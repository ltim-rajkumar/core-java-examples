    * Exception
     * Exception handling in Java allows developers to manage runtime errors effectively
     * by using mechanisms like try-catch block, finally block, throwing Exceptions,
     * Custom Exception handling, etc.
     *
     * An Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that occurs during the execution of a program
     * (i.e., at runtime) and disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions.
     * It occurs when something unexpected things happen, like accessing an invalid index,
     * dividing by zero, or trying to open a file that does not exist.
     *
     * Exception in Java is an error condition that occurs
     * when something wrong happens during the program execution.
